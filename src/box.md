# The box

As I said earlier, I expect this gizmo will be tossed into a drawer and ignored
for years at a time. The last time I got interested in integrating a 1W
temperature sensor into a project was almost a decade ago. To give it a chance
of living as that hypothetical drawer (no, it's an actual drawer) gets
rototilled looking for some lost trinket from my past it seemed wise to enclose
it. I'm using a Pi Zero W prototype board so I suppose I could use a Pi Zero W
enclosure, but I don't have one tall enough to clear the pins and devices.

What I do have is a Bambu Labs P1S 3D printer, and a bit of PETG, and Autodesk
Fusion, and an hour to spare. Making the box involved pulling down somebody
else's CAD model of a Pi Zero W for dimensions, drawing and extruding my
outlines and supports in Fusion, and exporting the result as a STEP file to the
printer.

Here are the [design files](https://a360.co/3QqrmPF), and [the resulting STEP
model](assets/1w-tester-case.step). It appears I can only share the design for
reference, not for use, without paying Autodesk for a Fusion subscription. Still
it's an amazing pile of functionality they make available at no cost for
non-commercial uses like this, and I'm grateful to have it available.

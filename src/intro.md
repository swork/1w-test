# Introduction

I made a small test box combining a collection of 1Wire devices onto a 1Wire bus
and presenting it to a master through a pin header. I'm documenting it here as
it will likely get thrown into a drawer and brought out in a few years, the next
time I do something with 1Wire, when I'm unlikely to remember the details.

I built the board by hand over a Schmartboard Pi Zero W prototyping board I had
already, <https://schmartboard.com/> (specifically
[this](https://schmartboard.com/raspberry-pi/pi-zero/)). These are similar to
permanent breadboards with patterned interconnects between through-hole
locations, but denser than normal and with the doubled holes offset 50% from the
"normal" pattern. It's good kit, with well-tinned solder points and well
thought-out wiring. The pin header location, intended to match up with a
Raspberry Pi Zero's 40-pin header, happens to be well sized and placed for my
intentions.
